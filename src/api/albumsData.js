            description: 'OK Computer is the third studio album by English rock band Radiohead, released on 21 May 1997 on EMI subsidiaries Parlophone and Capitol Records. The members of Radiohead self-produced the album with Nigel Godrich, an arrangement they have used for their subsequent albums. Other than the song "Lucky", recorded in 1995, Radiohead recorded OK Computer in Oxfordshire and Bath between 1996 and early 1997, mostly in the historic mansion St Catherine\'s Court. The band distanced themselves from the guitar-centred, lyrically introspective style of their previous album, The Bends. OK Computer\'s abstract lyrics, densely layered sound and eclectic influences laid the groundwork for Radiohead\'s later, more experimental work.',

            description: 'Transformer is the second solo studio album by American recording artist Lou Reed. The album is considered an influential landmark of the glam rock genre, anchored by Reed\'s most successful single, "Walk on the Wild Side", which touched on then-controversial topics of sexual orientation, gender identity, prostitution, and drug use. Produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson, the album was released in November 1972 by RCA Records. Though Reed\'s self-titled debut solo album had been unsuccessful, Bowie had been an early fan of Reed\'s former band The Velvet Underground, and used his own fame to promote Reed, who had not yet achieved mainstream success.',

Released on 26 May 1967, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the Record Retailer chart in the United Kingdom and 15 weeks at number one on the Billboard Top LPs chart in the United States. It was lauded by critics for its innovations in songwriting, production and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for reflecting the interests of contemporary youth and the counterculture. Its release was a defining moment in 1960s pop culture, heralding the Summer of Love, while the album\'s reception achieved full cultural legitimisation for pop music and recognition for the medium as a genuine art form.',
